# Alyssa Natividad - Portfolio

## Description

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it.

This portfolio contains four sections:

- About Me section that includes the developer's name, an avatar, and a small description about the developer
- Projects section that contains a number of cards describing some of the previous works done by the developer. Each project contains a description of the project and links to the deployed project and github repository is found.
- Contact Me section that houses a form that can be filled out to reach out to the developer and also lists the ways the developer could be contacted.
- Resume section that lists the developer's proficiencies and where a copy of the developer's resume can be downloaded.

This web application is made using HTML, Bootstrap, React, and JavaScript.
